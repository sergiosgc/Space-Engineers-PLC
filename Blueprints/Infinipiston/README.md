The Infinipiston blueprint is here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2803179486

The .petrinet file here generates the script for the programmable block, using the [Petri Net Editor](https://sergiosgc.github.io/Space-Engineers-PLC/Editor/). 
Save the .petrinet file, then load it into the editor. Edit as needed and the hit "Compile" and paste the code from your clipboard into the editor.

Run the programmable block with "extend" or "retract" parameters. Or use the buttons present in the blueprint.
